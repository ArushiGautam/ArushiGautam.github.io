title: Software Installation
---

The purpose of this homework assignment is to get you set up with the software tools we'll use in PIC16B, including Anaconda, git + GitHub, and Jekyll. 

## ยง1. Install and Configure Anaconda

Follow the instructions [here](https://philchodrow.github.io/PIC16B/installation/) to install and configure Anaconda. Note that you are required to submit a screencap on CCLE to verify your installation. 

## ยง2. GitHub

Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/). 

## ยง3. GitHub Desktop

Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), a graphical client for working with `git`. If you do not use GitHub Desktop (or another graphical client), you will need to work with `git` from the command line. 

Connect your GitHub Desktop app to your GitHub account. 

## ยง4. Install and verify Jekyll

In this course, we'll use the Jekyll static website generator to create a simple, attractive website on which to host our homework and project submissions. Installation of Jekyll requires some minimal use of the command line (terminal), but the instructions will guide you through it. 

- Install Jekyll on [Windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/)
- Install Jekyll on [macOS](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/)
- Install Jekyll on [Ubuntu](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/) or [other Linux](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/other-linux/) systems. 

Once you've followed these instructions, verify your installation. To do so, run the following command in your terminal: 

```bash 
jekyll -v
```

The terminal output should look something like this: 

```bash
jekyll 4.1.0
```
Take a screencap of that output and submit it on CCLE.
