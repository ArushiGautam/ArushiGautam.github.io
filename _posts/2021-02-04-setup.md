title: Your new blog!
---

This website is a demonstration of the blog that you will create, maintain, and update as a student in PIC16B. To get started with your own version of this blog, you should follow the instructions at the [Jekyll Now GitHub Repo](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now#quick-start). However, instead of forking that repo, you should instead fork the [PIC16B demo website repo](https://github.com/PIC16B/PIC16B.github.io). All other instructions remain the same. 

After forking the repository and verifying that your blog is now on the web, your next step is to choose whether you would like to always edit your blog on GitHub or download your blog and edit it locally. While both are possible, the latter approach is highly recommended. To download your blog, clone it via the GitHub Desktop app. You'll then be able to edit files and create posts in your text editor of choice. Jupyter Lab is one good option, although dedicated text editors like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (my personal choice) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (also excellent) are perhaps even better. 

Whether working online or locally, your next step is to update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

If working locally, make sure to commit and push your changes. After a few minutes, they'll be live on your website. 

## Modifying Appearance

There are many ways to modify the appearance of your website. If you are comfortable with `css`, then you can directly modify `style.scss` and other files in the repo. If you want to get fancier, you can look into migrating to one of the many available themes in the [Jekyll theme gallery](https://jekyllthemes.io/free). Please note that, while theming your website can be fun and satisfying, it is outside the scope of the course. As consequence, neither I nor the TA will help you troubleshoot your website if you are using a theme.
